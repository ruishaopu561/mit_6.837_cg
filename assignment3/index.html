<h1>6.837 Intro to Computer Graphics<br>
Assignment 3: OpenGL & Phong Shading</h1>

<p>
In this assignment, you will add an interactive preview of the scene,
and implement Phong Shading in your ray tracer.  For interactive
display, you will use the OpenGL API that uses graphics hardware for
fast rendering of 3D polygons.  Note: with some configurations,
software emulation might be used, resulting in slower rendering.  You
will be able to interactively pre-visualize your scene and change the
viewpoint, then use your ray-tracer for higher-quality rendering.
Most of the infrastructure is provided to you, and you will just need
to add functions that send the appropriate triangle-rendering commands
to the API to render or <em>paint</em> each kind of <tt>Object3D</tt>
primitive.

In OpenGL, you display primitives by sending commands to the API.  The
API takes care of the perspective projection and the various other
transformations, and also <em>rasterizes</em> polygons, i.e., it
draws the appropriate pixels for each polygon.  (In lecture, we will
talk about how this is done using the <em>rendering pipeline</em>).
In addition, the infrastructure we provide takes care of the user
interface and how the mouse controls the camera.

<p>
To use OpenGL on Athena, you will first need to obtain access to the
OpenGL libraries and header files.  To do this, from an Athena prompt,
type:

<pre>
   add mesa_v501
</pre>

<p>All files implementing OpenGL code should include the OpenGL header
   files:

<pre>
   // Included files for OpenGL Rendering
   #include &lt;GL/gl.h&gt;
   #include &lt;GL/glu.h&gt;
   #include &lt;GL/glut.h&gt;
</pre>

We provide an updated <a href="Makefile"><tt>Makefile</tt></a> to
link with the OpenGL libraries on Athena Linux.  If you are using
Windows, then you may need to download the OpenGL libraries yourself
from <a href="http://www.opengl.org">http://www.opengl.org</a>.

<h3>Tasks</h3>

<ul>
<li>Add an OpenGL pre-visualization interface to your ray tracer,
    using the <tt>GLCanvas</tt> class.  You will need to create a
    <tt>GLCanvas</tt> instance in your main routine and call the
    following function:

<pre>
   void glCanvas::initialize(SceneParser *_scene, void (*_renderFunction)(void));
</pre>

<p>The <tt>initialize</tt> routine takes two parameters: The first is
   a pointer to the global scene.  The second is the function that
   will perform the raytracing.  The <tt>GLCanvas</tt> class is set up
   so that the renderFunction takes no parameters and has a
   <tt>void</tt> return type.  From within the real-time interface
   (with the mouse cursor within the frame of the GL display window),
   you can call the render function by pressing <tt>'r'</tt>.  Once
   the initialize routine is called, the <tt>GLCanvas</tt> will take over
   control of the application and will monitor all mouse and keyboard
   events.  This routine will not return, although the application can
   be terminated by pressing <tt>'q'</tt>, by closing the window, or
   calling <tt>exit()</tt>.

<p>
<ul>
<li><a href="glCanvas.h">glCanvas.h</a>
<li><a href="glCanvas.C">glCanvas.C</a>
</ul>

<p>
<li>Modify your camera implementation to control the interactive
    camera.  Copy-paste the code provided in
    <tt>camera_additions.txt</tt> into your camera files, and update
    it to re-normalize and re-orthogonalize the up, direction, and
    horizontal vectors (similar to the camera constructor).  Make sure
    you read the comments provided in <tt>camera_additions.txt</tt>,
    as these will help you avoid some common pitfalls.  Also pay close
    attention to the variable names in the provided code, as these may
    not correspond to the variable names in your own code.

<p>
<ul>
<li><a href="camera_additions.txt">camera_additions.txt</a>
</ul>

<p>Use the left mouse button to rotate the camera around the center of
   the scene, the middle mouse button to translate the scene center
   (truck), and the right mouse button to move the camera closer to or
   further from the scene (dolly).  To prevent weird rotations of the
   camera, it is necessary to store the original up vector of the
   camera and define a new "screen up" vector that is the normalized
   orthogonal up vector for the current direction vector.  You can
   test your implementation at this point.  In the
   <tt>GLCanvas::display()</tt> function is a call to the provided
   <tt>drawAxes()</tt> function, which will allow you to debug your
   camera implementation.  

<p>Once you start working on your <tt>Object3D</tt> paint methods
   (described below), you should comment out the call to
   <tt>drawAxes</tt>.  Once your paint methods are complete, verify
   that your camera manipulation code is correct by moving the camera,
   rendering the scene & then comparing the pre-visualization to the
   raytraced result.

<p>
<li>Derive a new <tt>PhongMaterial</tt> class from <tt>Material</tt>
    that adds a specular component (highlight).  The constructor
    expected by the scene parser is:

<pre>
  PhongMaterial::PhongMaterial(const Vec3f &diffuseColor, 
     const Vec3f &specularColor, float exponent);
</pre>

<p>Make the original <tt>Material</tt> class pure virtual by adding a
   pure virtual method <tt>Shade</tt> that computes the local
   interaction of light and the material:

<pre>
  virtual Vec3f Material::Shade
    (const Ray &ray, const Hit &hit, const Vec3f &dirToLight, 
     const Vec3f &lightColor) const = 0;
</pre>

<p>It takes as input the viewing ray, the Hit data structure, and
   light information and returns the color for that pixel.  Implement
   the the Blinn-Torrance version of the Phong model taught in
   lecture.  We suggest this version simply because it is what OpenGL
   uses, and the pre-visualization will thus be more similar.

<p>Note: We've only included one type of light source in our scenes,
   directional light sources, which have no falloff.  That is, the
   distance to the light source has no impact on the intensity of
   light received at a particular point in space.  So you may ignore
   the r<sup>2</sup> term in the Phong lighting model for this
   assignment.  Next week we will add a second type of light source, a
   point light source, and the distance from the surface to the light
   will be important.

<p>
<li>OpenGL can also compute local illumination.  You'll need to add
    the <tt>virtual void Material::glSetMaterial() const</tt> member
    function to <tt>Material</tt> (we have provided the code).  This
    function will send the appropriate OpenGL commands to specify the
    local shading model.

<p>
<ul>
<li><a href="material_additions.txt">material_additions.txt</a>
</ul>


<p>In the examples below we illustrate an artifact that occurs at
   grazing angles for wide specular lobes (small exponents).  To solve
   this problem, the specular component can be multiplied by the dot
   product of the normal and direction to the light instead of simply
   clamping it to zero when this dot product is negative.  You may
   implement either method in your ray tracer.  To enable the specular
   lobe fix in OpenGL, a 3-pass rendering has been provided in the
   code (by default only the single pass rendering is performed).  It
   is not required that you use or understand this code.

<p>
<li>Add a pure virtual <tt>void paint()</tt> method to
    <tt>Object3D</tt> and implement it for each subclass.  This
    function executes the appropriate OpenGL calls to render each
    object in the pre-visualization interface.  Before sending any
    OpenGL geometric commands, you will need to call the <tt>void
    Material::glSetMaterial() const</tt> member function to set up the
    OpenGL material parameters.  Some useful code is provided in
    <tt><a
    href="object3d_additions.txt">object3d_additions.txt</a></tt>.

<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Group - </b> Similar to its intersection method, a group
    implements <tt>paint()</tt> by iterating over all its children and
    calling their <tt>paint()</tt> methods.

<p>
<li><b>Triangle - </b> OpenGL is based on polygons.  You tell the API
    to render a polygon by first telling it that you start a polygon,
    then describing all the vertices and their properties, and finally
    closing the polygon.  The code to specify just the positions of a
    single triangle looks like this:

<pre>
   glBegin(GL_TRIANGLES);
   glVertex3f(x0, y0, z0);
   glVertex3f(x1, y1, z1);
   glVertex3f(x2, y2, z2);
   glEnd();
</pre>

<p> Alternatively, you can directly specify an array of floats for
    each vertex using <tt>glVertex3fv(float *array)</tt>.  To set the
    triangle normal, use one of the following commands before
    specifying the vertices:

<pre>
   glNormal3f(float x, float y, float z);     // List of floats
   glNormal3fv(float *arr);                   // Array of floats
</pre>

<p>Remember that you can compute the normal of a triangle using a
   cross product. 

<p>
<li><b>Plane - </b> OpenGL does not have an infinite plane primitive.
    To pre-visualize planes, you will simply draw very big rectangles.
    Project the world origin (0,0,0) onto the plane, and compute two
    basis vectors for the plane that are orthogonal to the plane
    normal <b>n</b>.  The first basis vector may be obtained by taking
    the cross product between <b>n</b> and another vector <b>v</b>.
    Any vector <b>v</b> will do the trick, as long as it is not
    parallel to <b>n</b>.  So you can always use <b>v</b>=(1,0,0)
    except when <b>n</b> is along the x axis, in which case you can
    use <b>v</b>=(0,1,0).  Then the first basis vector,
    <b>b<sub>1</sub></b>, is <b>v</b> x <b>n</b> and the second basis
    vector, <b>b<sub>2</sub></b>, is <b>n</b> x <b>b<sub>1</sub></b>.
    Display a rectangle from (-<em>big</em>, -<em>big</em>) to
    (<em>big</em>, <em>big</em>) in this 2D basis, for some big number
    <em>big</em>.  (Caution: OpenGL does not like rendering points at
    INFINITY.  <em>big</em> should probably be &lt; 10<sup>6</sup>)

<pre>
   glBegin(GL_QUADS);
   glNormal3f(nx, ny, nz);
   glVertex3f(x0, y0, z0);
   glVertex3f(x1, y1, z1);
   glVertex3f(x2, y2, z2);
   glVertex3f(x3, y3, z3);
   glEnd();
</pre>


<p>
<li><b>Sphere - </b>OpenGL does not have a sphere primitive, so
    spheres must be transformed into polygons, a process known as
    <em>tessellation</em>.  (Actually, <tt>glu</tt> does have a sphere
    primitive, but you are not allowed to use this shortcut for the
    assignment).  You will implement the classic sphere tessellation
    using angular parameters <em>theta</em> and <em>phi</em>.  The
    number of steps in <em>theta</em> and <em>phi</em> will be
    controlled by the command line argument <tt>-tessellation
    &lt;theta-steps&gt; &lt;phi-steps&gt;</tt>.  Deduce the
    corresponding angle increments, and use two nested loops on the
    angles to generate the appropriate polygons.  Note that
    <em>theta</em> should vary between 0 and 360 degrees, while
    <em>phi</em> must vary between -90 and 90 degrees. 

    <p>
    In OpenGL, you may include 3<em>n</em> vertex positions within the
    <tt>glBegin</tt> and <tt>glEnd</tt> commands to draw <em>n</em>
    triangles (or 4<em>n</em> vertices to draw <em>n</em> quads):

<pre>
   glBegin(GL_QUADS);
     for (iPhi=...; iPhi<...; iPhi+=...)
       for (int iTheta=...; iTheta=...; iTheta+=...) {
         // compute appropriate coordinates & normals
	 ...

         // send gl vertex commands
         glVertex3f(x0, y0, z0);
         glVertex3f(x1, y1, z1);
         glVertex3f(x2, y2, z2);
         glVertex3f(x3, y3, z3);
       }
     }
   glEnd();
</pre>

<p>You will implement two versions of sphere normals: flat shading
   (visible facets) and <em>Gouraud interpolation</em>.  By default
   your previsualization should use flat shading; that is, simply the
   normal of each triangle, as you would for polygon rendering.  When
   the <tt>-gouraud</tt> option is specified, your pre-visualization
   should render with Gouraud interpolation, and use the true normal
   of the sphere for each vertex (set the vertex normal before
   specifying each vertex position).  Note how this improves the
   appearance of the sphere and makes it smoother.  OpenGL performs
   bilinear interpolation between the shaded color values computed at
   each vertex.  Remember that this is not as good as the <em>Phong
   interpolation</em> described in class (which interpolates the
   surface normals and then performs the lighting calculation per
   pixel).

<p>
<li><b>Transformation - </b> Finally, you must handle transformations.
   OpenGL will do most of the work for you.  You only need to specify
   that you want to change the current object-space-to-world-space 4x4
   matrix.  To do this, you first need to save the current matrix on a
   matrix stack using <tt>glPushMatrix()</tt>.  Then change the matrix
   using <tt>glMultMatrix(GLfloat *fd)</tt>.  Use the <tt>glGet()</tt>
   routine to the <tt>Matrix</tt> class to construct a matrix with the
   appropriate structure.  OpenGL matrices created with this routine
   should be deleted when they are no longer needed:

<pre>
  glPushMatrix();
  GLfloat *glMatrix = matrix.glGet();
  glMultMatrixf(glMatrix);
  delete[] glMatrix;
</pre>

<p>Then, recursively call the <tt>paint()</tt> method of the child
   object.  After this, you must restore the previous matrix from the
   stack using:

<pre>
  glPopMatrix();
</pre>

<p>If you do not save and restore the matrix, your transformation will
   be applied to all the following primitives!

</ul>

</ul>

<h3>Hints</h3>

<ul>

<li>As usual, debug your code as you write it.  Initially implement
    empty <tt>paint()</tt> functions for the Object3D subclasses.  Run
    intermediate examples to make sure that sub-parts are sane.

<li>To improve performance, you may extract the values that do not need
    to be recomputed for each frame and cache them.  For example, you
    might want to store triangle normals or the tessellation
    coordinates of a sphere.  As usual, there is a trade off between
    speed and memory.

</ul>

<h3>Ideas for Extra Credit</h3>


<ul>
<li>Implement the original Phong model (in addition to the
Blinn-Torrance variation) and compare, add an approximation of the
fresnel effect, implement a fish eye camera, etc.</ul>
