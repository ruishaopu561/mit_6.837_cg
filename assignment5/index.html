<h1>6.837 Intro to Computer Graphics<br>
Assignment 5: Voxel Rendering</h1>

<p>
In this assignment and the next, you will make your ray tracer faster
using a spatial-acceleration data structure. This week we will focus
on the implementation of a grid data structure and on fast ray grid
intersection.  Next week you will use the grid to accelerate your ray
tracer.

<p>
To test your grid structure, you will implement the grid as a modeling
primitive. Volumetric modeling can be implemented by affecting a
binary opaqueness value for each grid cell. This is the equivalent of
the discrete pixel representation of 2D images. Each volume element
(or voxel) will be rendered as a solid cube.  You can easily rasterize
simple primitives in a grid (similar to pixel rasterization).  For
example, to rasterize a sphere, simply compare the distance between
the center of a voxel and the sphere center to the sphere radius.  You
will use the grid to store the objects of your scene.  In order to
test your object insertion code, you will render cells that contain
one or more objects as opaque and use color to visualize the density.

<p>
Initially, you may assume that no transformations are used.  This way
you may effectively ignore the group hierarchy and insert all
primitives by scanning the scene in a depth-first manner.  For the
later test cases you will need to correctly transform the bounding
boxes of each primitive before rasterizing it to the grid.

<h3>Tasks</h3>

<ul>

<p>
<li>Extend your <tt>Object3D</tt> class to include a pointer to a
    <tt>BoundingBox</tt> instance.  Each subclass should compute its
    conservative bounding box in its constructor, as appropriate.  As
    discussed in class, the bounding box of a group is simply the
    union of the bounding boxes of the contained objects.  The
    conservative bounding box of a transformed object is computed by
    transforming the 8 corners of the original bounding box and taking
    their axis-aligned bounding box.  Add the accessor method
    <tt>BoundingBox* Object3D::getBoundingBox()</tt>.

<p>
<ul>
<li><a href="boundingbox.h">boundingbox.h</a>
<li><a href="boundingbox.C">boundingbox.C</a>
</ul>

<p>To avoid creating an infinite bounding box, don't try to compute
   the bounding box of a <tt>Plane</tt> (the <tt>BoundingBox</tt> of
   this primitive should be NULL).  Don't include this infinite
   primitive when computing the bounding box of a group.  Test your
   bounding box code by printing out the intermediate and scene
   bounding boxes for various test cases from previous assignments.
   Make sure your code handles scenes whose bounding box <em>does
   not</em> include the origin.

<p>
<li>Derive from <tt>Object3D</tt> a <tt>Grid</tt> class for an
    axis-aligned uniform grid.  Initially a <tt>Grid</tt> will simply
    store whether each cell (voxel) is occupied so it can be rendered
    opaque or transparent. The constructor takes a pointer to the
    <tt>BoundingBox</tt> of the scene, and three integers describing
    the number of cells along the three axes.

<pre>
    Grid::Grid(BoundingBox *bb, int nx, int ny, int nz); 
</pre>

<p>Internal to your grid class, an array of <em>n<sub>x</sub></em> x
   <em>n<sub>y</sub></em> x <em>n<sub>z</sub></em> boolean values
   stores whether each voxel is opaque or transparent.  Later we'll
   replace this array of booleans with an array of arrays of
   <tt>Objects3D</tt>.

<p>
<li>Extend your <tt>Object3D</tt> class with a new method:

<pre>
   virtual void insertIntoGrid(Grid *g, Matrix *m);
</pre>

<p>Note that this function is <em>not</em> pure virtual.  Initially
   this function will do nothing.  Override this function for spheres
   by implementing the corresponding method for the <tt>Sphere</tt>
   class.  This method sets the opaqueness of each voxel which
   <em>may</em> intersect the sphere.  You can do this by comparing
   the center of voxel to the sphere center and radius.  Your
   computation should be conservative: you must label cells which
   might overlap the sphere, but it's also ok to label cells opaque
   which do not overlap the sphere.  You may ignore the 2nd argument
   (<tt>Matrix *m</tt>) for this part, it will be used later in the
   assignment.

<p>
<li>Extend your <tt>RayTracer</tt> class to have a pointer to a
    <tt>Grid</tt> instance.  Add support for two new command line
    arguments: <tt>-grid &lt;nx&gt; &lt;ny&gt; &lt;nz&gt;</tt>, to
    specify the size of the grid; and <tt>-visualize_grid</tt>, which
    indicates that the grid occupancy should be drawn instead of the
    scene objects.  If the <tt>-grid</tt> command line option is not
    used, the grid will be <tt>NULL</tt>.  Within the
    <tt>RayTracer</tt> constructor you'll initialize the grid and
    insert all of the objects in your scene into that grid.  You'll
    need to write <tt>Group::insertIntoGrid</tt>, which like all group
    methods simply calls <tt>insertIntoGrid</tt> for all contained
    objects.  Now you can test your sphere-rasterization routine with
    the first examples by simply printing the values of the grid's
    boolean array.

<p>
<li>Implement <tt>Grid::paint()</tt> to previsualize the occupancy of
    your grid.  You may simply render 6 quads for each occupied grid
    cell, or to be more efficient, only draw the faces between
    occupied and unoccupied cells.  Initially test your code with a
    very small grid (e.g. 1x1x1), on simple scenes.  Make sure you
    have specified the correct normals.  

<p>
<li>Implement ray marching through the grid so that you can also
    raytrace a visualization of grid occupancy.  <em>Note: By using
    3DDDA we can do this much more efficiently than computing a
    ray-box intersection with each voxel!</em> You will only use
    ray-box intersection to find the initial intersection of the ray
    with the scene bounding box.

<p>You will need a place to store the information for the current ray
   and the current grid cell. Implement a <tt>MarchingInfo</tt> class
   that stores the current value of <em>tmin</em>; the grid indices
   <em>i</em>, <em>j</em>, and <em>k</em> for the current grid cell;
   the next values of intersection along each axis (<em>t_next_x</em>,
   <em>t_next_y</em>, and <em>t_next_z</em>); the marching increments
   along each axis (<em>d_tx</em>, <em>d_ty</em>, <em>d_tz</em>), and
   the sign of the direction vector components (<em>sign_x</em>,
   <em>sign_y</em>, and <em>sign_z</em>).  To render the occupied grid
   cells for visualization you will also need to store the surface
   normal of the cell face which was crossed to enter the current
   cell.  Write the appropriate accessors and modifiers.

<p>
<li>The intersection of a <tt>Ray</tt> with a <tt>Grid</tt> will use
    two helper functions to initialize the march and to move to the
    next cell.  First write:

<pre>
   void Grid::initializeRayMarch(MarchingInfo &mi, const Ray &r, float tmin) const;
</pre>

<p>This function computes the marching increments and the information
   for the first cell traversed by the ray. Make sure to treat all
   three intersection cases: when the origin is inside the grid, when
   it is outside and the ray hits the grid, and when it is outside and
   it misses the grid.  Test your <tt>initializeRayMarch</tt> routine
   by manually casting simple axis-aligned rays into a low-resolution
   grid.  Also test more general cases.  Make sure to test ray origins
   which are inside and outside the scene bounding box.  Next,
   implement:

<pre>
   void MarchingInfo::nextCell();
</pre>

<p>This update routine choose the smallest of the next t values
   (<em>t_next_x</em>, <em>t_next_y</em>, and <em>t_next_z</em>), and
   updates the corresponding cell index.  Test your <tt>nextCell</tt>
   ray marching code using the same strategy as for initialization.
   Manually compute the marching sequence corresponding to a
   particular ray and then print the steps taken by your code.  Try
   other origins and directions to make sure that your code works for
   all orientations (in particular, test both positive and negative
   components of the direction).

<p>
<li>To help you debug your ray marching code, we've added additional
    previsualization options to the <tt>RayTree</tt> class introduced
    in the last assignment.  As before, a single ray is traced by
    pressing the '<tt>t</tt>' key.  Then the '<tt>g</tt>' key will
    toggle between (1) visualizing all occupied grid cells, (2)
    visualizing the cells traversed while walking along the ray, and
    (3) the faces crossed to enter each cell along the ray.

<p>
<ul>
<li><a href="rayTree.h">rayTree.h</a>
<li><a href="rayTree.C">rayTree.C</a>
<li><a href="glCanvas.h">glCanvas.h</a>
<li><a href="glCanvas.C">glCanvas.C</a>
</ul>

<p><tt>GLCanvas::initialize</tt> method has been modified to take in two
   additional parameters, the <tt>Grid</tt>, and a boolean indicating
   whether to visualize the grid or not.  Insert the following
   commands within your <tt>Grid</tt> intersection routines as
   appropriate:

<pre>
  void RayTree::AddHitCellFace(Vec3f a, Vec3f b, Vec3f c, Vec3f d, Vec3f normal, Material *m);
  void RayTree::AddEnteredFace(Vec3f a, Vec3f b, Vec3f c, Vec3f d, Vec3f normal, Material *m);
</pre>

<p>To specify an entire cell, call <tt>AddHitCellFace</tt> 6 times.
   In the examples below, a color gradient has been used to show the
   order in which the cells are traversed (white, purple, ... orange,
   red).  This gradient is optional, but can be helpful in debugging.
   To see the ray intersections more clearly, you may wish to turn off
   the transparent ray rendering in <tt>RayTree::paint()</tt>

<p>
<li>Now, use the two helpers functions in your ray tracer.  The
   <tt>Grid::initializeRayMarch</tt> routine should be called at the
   beginning of the <tt>Grid::intersect routine</tt>.  Once the
   <tt>MarchingInfo</tt> data structure is initialized,
   <tt>MarchingInfo::nextCell</tt> should be used to walk through the
   grid and check for opaque voxels.  If the next cell is
   opaque/occupied, return the appropriate normal depending on which
   axis you advanced last.  Verify that your raytraced image looks the
   same as the OpenGL previsualization.


<p>
<li>Rasterize all scene primitives (but not groups and transforms)
    into the appropriate cells of the grid.  You'll need to modify the
    <tt>Grid</tt> class to store pointers to the objects whose
    bounding box overlaps the cell instead of simply boolean occupancy 
    values.  We've provided a dynamically resizable vector class,
    <tt>Object3DVector</tt>, to store an arbitrary number of
    <tt>Object3D</tt> pointers.  You may use STL (Standard Template
    Library) instead if you prefer.

<p>
<ul>
<li><a href="object3dvector.h">object3dvector.h</a>
</ul>

<p>In the examples below, a color gradient has been used to visualize
   the number of primitives which overlap each grid cell.  Cells
   colored white have just 1 primitive, purple have 2 primitives, ...
   and cells colored red have many more.  You should implement a
   similar visualization, but you may use a different color scheme.

<p>
<li>Finally, extend your implementation to correctly handle
    transformations.  We could explicitly "flatten" the object
    hierarchy to create a new scene graph with a single transformation
    above each primitive.  But it's also easy to just push all the
    transformations down to the primitive objects.  Now we'll use the
    2nd argument (<tt>Matrix *m</tt>) to
    <tt>Object3D::insertIntoGrid</tt> (and it's derived methods).
    Initially <tt>m = NULL</tt>.  When you encounter a
    transformation node in the hierarchy you will concatenate it to
    the previous transformation (if any).  Make sure you apply the
    transformations in the correct order.

<p>You are not required to handle transformations in your
   <tt>Sphere::insertIntoGrid</tt> method.  If <tt>m &ne; NULL</tt>,
   it's ok to fall back on the <tt>Object3D::insertIntoGrid</tt>
   implementation.  To explicitly call a parent class method, pre-pend
   the method with the class name:

<pre>
    this->Object3D::insertIntoGrid(g,m);
</pre>

<p>NOTE: We won't test or grade your transformation code until the
   next assignment, so it's ok if this isn't fully implemented or
   debugged yet.  But we highly recommend that you try to do so now.
   Test scenes 10, 11, & 12 contain transformations.

</ul>

<h3>Ideas for Extra Credit</h3>

<ul>
<li>Implement a special case for transformations of triangle
    primitives to get a tighter bounding box

<li>Test if the plane of the triangles intersects the grid cells (less
    useful for small triangles)

<li>Volumetric rasterization of other fun implicit objects

</ul>
